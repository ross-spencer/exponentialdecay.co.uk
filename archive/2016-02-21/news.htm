	The beta for the latest exponentialdecay.co.uk did not last long. It was a good experiement in the use
	of XML/XSLT for general web page output. The discovery of this experiment was that this method relies
	heavily on the design of the website specifically for output through XSLT. The links are no longer
	available to view this site. --rs--

	RSS. It has only taken a 12 Months. Still check out the new <a class="a2" href="/rss/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>
	for exponentialdecay.co.uk. Nice to have one finally, now to find something to put there.

	Beavis can you spare a dime? Currently the news is I am looking for a job as a grad C++
	developer. In the meantime there has been ample opportunity to bone up my C++ and other 
	language skills, hence the construction of this website, I've actually had time to do it!
	This I guess is the first news post of the new site! enjoy. --rs--
