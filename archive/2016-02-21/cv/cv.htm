		<h4>
		Employment History
		</h4>
		<p>
			Employer: Archives New Zealand
			<br/>
			Job Title: Digital Preservation Analyst
			<br/>
			From: 4 March 2013
			<br/>
			To: Present
		</p>
		<p>
			Digital Preservation Analyst at Archives New Zealand whose primary role is to support the System, Strategy, Standards team (SSS) formerly Digital Continuity; in making preservation decisions and providing digital preservation guidance. Having worked with colleagues to help enable Archive New Zealand's first born-digital ingests of legacy accessions from the past decade, my current responsibilities include the furthering of those tools and solutions to see solutions applied more broadly to additional accessions from the same era. Other roles I have within the organization require me to work closely with digital preservation colleagues at National Library New Zealand and the Alexander Turnbull Library to develop Digital Preservation Policy. The role also has a high requirement for outreach and helping government departments and councils outside of the Department of Internal Affairs to understand their digital preservation, and continuity needs, providing guidance and support where possible. I maintain strong personal links with the wider digital preservation community an try and ensure progress within the organization is shared outside for its potential benefit, as we also benefit from the larger community effort.  
		</p>
<br/>
		<p>
			Employer: The National Archives
			<br/>
			Job Title: Digital Preservation Researcher
			<br/>
			From: 1st June 2009
			<br/>
			To: 7 September 2012
		</p>
		<p>
         The main focus of my role at The National Archives was the research and provision of solutions to the end of preserving government's digital records. The main requirements of this role include researching file format specifications and developing binary signatures based on the internal representation of the format for the organization’s DROID tool. Based on this research I also produced guidelines for internal and external consumption documenting digital preservation best practice. My research has allowed me to write solutions and proof of concept tools in C++ and Python. I developed a tool to validate JPEG2000 headers and custom metadata stored within JP2 XML elements. I provided input to projects outside of The National Archives including being part of the JPEG2000 working group for the Wellcome Trust. Further, I was involve with the Planets Project, contributing to and reviewing reports. I was part of initial reviews and discussions surrounding the Unified Digital File Formats registry (UDFR). 
		</p>
		<p>
			My primary research focus before leaving The National Archives was the conversion and release of our online file format database PRONOM as linked open data. This work looked at converting legacy table based data to RDF triples for delivery; the development of a PHP user interface for browsing and maintenance of data; and the development of legacy SOAP web services, connected to a SPARQL endpoint, for integration with existing systems at The National Archives. I worked with external stakeholders and projects outside of the organization to align efforts to connect multiple sources of information together; because beyond the technical solutions we develop for digital preservation and the semantic web, the communication and sharing of ideas is key. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Other development opportunities at The National Archives saw me write a JPEG2000 correction tool to fix an XML transcoding error in LuraTech CLT software in C++. I saw my JPEG2000 validation scripts embedded into the primary ingest workflow. I wrote an open source tool in PHP to output standalone DROID signature files for development and testing.

			Employer: Origin Data Realisation LTD / Red Box Recorders
			<br/>
			Job Title: Junior Analyst Programmer
			<br/>
			From: 11th November 2007
			<br/>
			To: 15th May 2009
		</p>
		<p>
			Junior Analyst Programmer developing VOIP recording solutions, primarily in C++. Areas of focus included improving existing solutions for recording Avaya, Nortel, Cisco, Ericsson and SIP VOIP calls, and implementing new solutions for VOIP providers such as Panasonic. Some other important protocols I focused on included, H225, Q931, and MGCP. I was also involved in back end development for our web front-end maintaining an ISAPI DLL. Front-end development required JavaScript and XHTML skills to add functionality to primarily a form based interface. I spearheaded a move to a more dynamic web based solution where possible by introducing the use of AJAX to the recorder front-end. The code produced in this role adhered to C++ Standards as strictly as possible and where possible using VC6.0 SP6.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Red Box I saw through a number of important projects including the implementation of a number of new features such as the dvelopment of a search filtering mechanism; and a recording as a service based solution for a new Cisco protocol at the time. I was also involved in a number of bug fixes large and small in numerous areas. Through my work at Red Box Recorders I developed greater problem solving abilities and a better grasp for meeting deadlines. The contributon of this role to my knowledge of digital forensics is immeasurable. I picked up a working knowledge of Wireshark and WinPcap. Interpretation of network protocols and standards was central to producing successful solutions. Where protocols hadn't been made available by a supplier it was important to discover reliable signalling patterns directly from the network traffic through reverse engineering.

		<h4>
			Interests
		</h4>
		<p>
			My professional and intellectual interests include digital preservation techniques, linked open data and programming. The preservation of born digital collections provides me with unique challenges, and often forces me to think of solutions not just within the digital realm. Developing better methods of accessing data and associated metadata for researchers is an area I'd like to investigate further. My personal interests include music and film; playing and watching sports; reading, and video games. I enjoy the design and development of ideas across a broad spectrum of areas. I am a keen road cyclist and have taken part in the Three Capitals in Three Days cycling challenge for the Mines Advisory Group (MAG). I am also seeking to take up piano lessons again after a two year hiatus.
